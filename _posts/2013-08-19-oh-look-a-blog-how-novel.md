Over the last year or so, whenever I figured something out that wasn't immediately obvious to anyone who knows how to use Google, I would tell myself, "Boy, it'd be handy to have a place to blog about that". But I didn't. And, because I was busy (and lazy), I left it at that.

Then my friend Ian put together [his spiffy little blog](ianwhitney.github.io) and explained how [Github Pages](pages.github.com) and [Jekyll Bootstrap](jekyllbootstrap.com) had made it dirt simple. Inspired, I set off down the same path. By which I mean I cribbed heavily from his setup (thanks, Ian!).

So, now that this blog is here, what can you expect from it? Since I'm developing and architecting software in PHP and Ruby with the occasional foray into Python, I'd say those topics are all fair game. Oh, and Vim. I'm a fan.

Anyway, thanks for stopping by. There'll be some more interesting content up soon. Hope to see you around.
