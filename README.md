## TODO

* Change font? It's a little weird.
* Paginate front page!
* Preserve category case, at least in page display
* Present tags in lowercase, not init-caps.
* Maybe do something interesting with pages.html or trash it.
* Reduce the font on the tags and categories pages. Maybe look into doing something more interesting there as well?
* Create a cute 404 page because every site these days needs a cute 404 page.
